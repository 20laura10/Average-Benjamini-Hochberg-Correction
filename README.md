# P-Value Correction: Average Benjamini-Hochberg Method

This repository contains Python code for testing and implementing the **Average Benjamini-Hochberg (aBH) Method** for p-value corrections. This statistical approach addresses the multiple testing problem, ensuring a controlled false discovery rate (FDR). 

Our experiments explore the behavior of this method under various conditions, with results documented in a separate paper/practical report.

## 📚 **Overview**

### What is the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure?  
The Benjamini-Hochberg method is a widely used technique in statistical hypothesis testing to control the FDR. This repository expands on the traditional BH method by calculating the average adjusted p-values under certain conditions.

### Key Objectives:
- Implement the Average BH correction in Python.
- Analyze the performance of the method on simulated datasets and real world omics datasets.
- Provide reproducible code for educational and research purposes.
